Islandora Workbench offers three "hooks" that can be used to run scripts at specific points in the Workbench execution lifecycle. The three hooks are:

1. Bootstrap and shutdown
1. CSV preprocessor
1. Post-action

Hook scripts can be in any language, and need to be executable by the user running Workbench.

Execution (whether successful or not) of hook scripts is logged, including the scripts' exit code.

## Bootstrap and shutdown scripts

Bootstrap scripts execute prior to Workbench connecting to Drupal. For an example of using this feature to run a script that generates sample Islandora content, see the "[Generating sample Islandora content](/islandora_workbench_docs/generating_sample_content/)" section.

To register a bootstrap script in your configuration file, add it to the `bootstrap` option, like this, indicating the absolute path to the script:

```yaml
bootstrap: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/scripts/generate_image_files.py"]
```

Each bootstrap script gets passed a single argument, the path to the Workbench config file that was specified in Workbench's `--config` argument. For example, if you are running Workbench with a config file called `create.yml`, "create.yml" will automatically be passed as the argument to your bootstrap script (you do not specify it in the configuration), like this:

`generate_image_files.py create.yml`

Shutdown scripts work the same way as bootstrap scripts but they execute after Workbench has finished connecting to Drupal. Like bootstrap scripts, shutdown scripts receive a single argument from Workbench, the path to your configuration file.

A common situation where a shutdown script is useful is to check the Workbench log for failures, and if any are detected, to email someone. The script `email_log_if_errors.py` in the `scripts` directory shows how this can be used for this.

To register a shutdown script, add it to the `shutdown` option:

```yaml
shutdown: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/shutdown_example.py"]
```

`--check` will check for the existence of bootstrap and shutdown scripts, and that they are executable, but does not execute them. The scripts are only executed when Workbench is run without `--check`.

A shutdown script that you might find useful is `scripts/generate_iiif_manifests.py`, which generates the IIIF Manifest (book-manifest) for each node in the current `create` task that is a parent. You might want to do this since pregenerating the manifest usually speeds up rendering of paged content in Mirador and OpenSeadragon. To use it, simply add the following to your `create` task config file, adjusting the path to your Workbench `scripts` directory:

```yaml
shutdown: ["/home/mark/hacking/workbench/scripts/generate_iiif_manifests.py"]
```

!!! warning
    Bootstrap and shutdown scripts get passed the path to your configuration file, but they only have access to the configuration settings explicitly defined in that file. In other words, any configuration setting with a default value, and therefore no necessarily included in your configuration file, is not known to  bootstrap/shutdown scripts.

    Therefore, it is good practice to include in your configuration file all configuration settings your script will need. The presence of a configuration setting set to its default value has no effect on Workbench.

## CSV preprocessor scripts

CSV preprocessor scripts are applied to CSV values in a specific CSV field prior to the values being ingested into Drupal. They apply to the entire value from the CSV field and not split field values, e.g., if a field is multivalued, the preprocessor must split it and then reassemble it back into a string. Note that preprocessor scripts work only on string data and not on binary data like images, etc. and only on custom fields (so not title). Preprocessor scripts are applied in `create` and `update` tasks.

!!! note
    If you are interested in seeing preprocessor scripts act on binary data such as images, see this [issue](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench/issues/45).

For example, if you want to convert all the values in the `field_description` CSV field to sentence case, you can do this by writing a small Python script that uses the `capitalize()` method and registering it as a preprocessor.

To register a preprocessor script in your configuration file, add it to the `preprocessors` setting, mapping a CSV column header to the path of the script, like this:

```yaml
preprocessors:
 - field_description: /home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/scripts/samplepreprocessor.py
```

You must provide the absolute path to the script, and the script must be executable.

Each preprocessor script gets passed two arguments:

1. the character used as the CSV subdelimiter (defined in the `subdelimiter` config setting, which defaults to `|`)
    - unlike bootstrap, shutdown, and post-action scripts, preprocessor scripts do not get passed the path to your Workbench configuration file; they only get passed the value of the `subdelimiter` config setting.
1. the CSV field value

When executed, the script processes the string content of the CSV field, and then replaces the original version of the CSV field value with the version processed by the script. An example preprocessor script is available in `scripts/samplepreprocessor.py`.

## Post-action scripts

Post-action scripts execute after a node is created or updated, or after a media is created.

!!! note
    If you want to execute scripts on nodes, media, and taxonomy terms outside of the events described here, you can do so using the [`run_scripts` task](/islandora_workbench_docs/running_scripts/).

To register post-action scripts in your configuration file, add them to either the `node_post_create`, `node_post_update`, or `media_post_create` configuration setting:

```yaml
node_post_create: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/post_node_create.py"]
```

```yaml
node_post_update: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/post_node_update.py"]
```

```yaml
media_post_create: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/post_media_update.py"]
```

The arguments passed to each post-action hook are:

1. the path to the Workbench config file that was specified in the `--config` argument
1. the HTTP response code returned from the action (create, update), e.g. `201` or `403`. Note that this response code is a string, not an integer.
1. the entire HTTP response body; this will be raw JSON.

These arguments are passed to post-action scripts automatically. You don't specific them when you register your scripts in your config file. The `scripts/entity_post_task_example.py` illustrates these arguments.

Your scripts can find the entity ID and other information within the (raw JSON) HTTP response body. Using the way Python decodes JSON as an example, if the entity is a node, its nid is in `entity_json['nid'][0]['value']`; if the entity is a media, the mid is in `entity_json['mid'][0]['value']`. The exact location of the nid and mid may differ if your script is written in a language that decodes JSON differently than Python (used in this example) does.

!!! warning
    Not all Workbench configuration settings are available in post-action scripts. Only the settings are explicitly defined in the configuration YAML are available.

    As with bootstrap and shutdown scripts, when using post-action scripts, it is good practice to include in your configuration file all configuration settings your script will need. The presence of a configuration setting set to its default value has no effect on Workbench.

### Running multiple scripts in one hook

For all types of hooks, you can register multiple scripts, like this:

```yaml
bootstrap: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/bootstrap_example_1.py", "/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/bootstrap_example_2.py"]
shutdown: ["/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/shutdown_example_1.py", "/home/mark/Documents/hacking/workbench/shutdown_example_2.py"]
node_post_create: ["/home/mark/scripts/email_someone.py", "/tmp/hit_remote_api.py"]
```

They are executed in the order in which they are listed.

## Paths to scripts, and specifying an interpreter

Regardless of the type of hook you are implementing, there are a couple of things that you should note:

- Paths to scripts must be absolute (as in the examples above). If you use a relative path to your script, Workbench will not find it.
- If your script does not contain a shebang line (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python` in Python scripts or `#!/usr/bin/sh` in shell scripts), you will need to specify the interpreter your script will need to execute. To do this, simply include the interpreter's full path or name at the beginning of the path to your script, e.g. `/usr/bin/sh /path/to/my/shell/script.sh`.
