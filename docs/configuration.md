## The configuration file

Workbench uses a YAML configuration whose location is indicated in the `--config` argument. This file defines the various options it will use to create, update, or delete Islandora content. The simplest configuration file needs only the following four options:

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora
```

In this example, the `task` being performed is creating nodes (and optionally media). Other tasks are `create_from_files`, `update`, `delete`, `add_media`, `update_media`, and `delete_media`. Some of the configuration settings documented below are used in all tasks, while others are only used in specific tasks.

## Configuration settings

The settings defined in a configuration file are documented in the tables below, grouped into broad functional categories for easier reference. The order of the options in the configuration file doesn't matter, and settings do not need to be grouped together in any specific way in the configuration file.

Note that you can define [some configuration settings](/islandora_workbench_docs/configuration_settings_on_the_command_line/) as command-line arguments to the workbench script. If they are provided as command-line arguments, they override the same settings in the configuration file.

### Printing all configuration values

If you need to see your current configuration (based on the default values for settings plus the settings in your config file), add `--print_config` as a command-line argument when you run Workbench. For example:

`./workbench --config myconfig.yml --print_config`

Workbench will not perform its task (e.g. it will not create or update content), it will just dump the configuration settings and stop running. Note that the value of the `password` setting is obfuscated but all other settings are exactly as defined by the Workbench defaults and what is in your current config file.

A couple of tricks you might find useful, if you are running Workbench on Linux or MacOS:

1. Print the configuration to a file: `./workbench --config myconfig.yml --print_config > myconfig.txt`
1. Filter out a single configuration setting (using `temp_dir` as an example): `./workbench --config myconfig.yml --print_config | grep temp_dir`

### Use of quotation marks

Generally speaking, you do not need to use quotation marks around values in your configuration file. You may wrap values in quotation marks if you wish, and many examples in this documentation do that (especially the `host` setting), but the only values that should not be wrapped in quotation marks are those that take `true` or `false` as values because in YAML, and many other computer/markup languages,`"true"` is a string (in this case, an English word that can mean many things) and `true` is a reserved symbol that can mean one thing and one thing only, the boolean opposite of `false` (I'm sorry for this explanation, I can't describe the distinction in any other way without writing a primer on symbolic logic).

For example, the following is a valid configuration file:

```yaml
task: create
host: http://localhost:8000
username: admin
password: islandora
nodes_only: true
csv_field_templates:
 - field_linked_agent: relators:aut:person:Jordan, Mark
 - field_model: 25
```

But the following version is not valid, since there are quotes around `"true"` in the `nodes_only` setting:

```yaml
task: create
host: http://localhost:8000
username: admin
password: islandora
nodes_only: "true"
csv_field_templates:
 - field_linked_agent: relators:aut:person:Jordan, Mark
 - field_model: 25
```

### Use of spaces and other syntactical features

Configuration setting names should start a new line and not have any leading spaces. The exception is illustrated in the values of the `csv_field_templates` setting in the above examples, where the setting's value is a list of other values. In this case the members of the list start with a dash and a space (`- `). The trailing space in these values is significant. (However, the leading space before the dash is insignificant, and is used for appearance only.) For example, this snippet is valid:

```yaml
csv_field_templates:
 - field_linked_agent: relators:aut:person:Jordan, Mark
 - field_model: 25
```

whereas this one is not:

```yaml
csv_field_templates:
 -field_linked_agent: relators:aut:person:Jordan, Mark
 -field_model: 25
```

Some setting values are represented in Workbench documentation using square brackets, like this one:

```yaml
export_csv_field_list: ['field_description', 'field_extent']
```

Strictly speaking, YAML lists can be represented as either a series of entries on their own lines that start with `- ` or as entries enclosed in `[` and `]`. It's best to follow the examples provided throughout the Workbench documentation.

### Required configuration settings

| Setting | Required | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task | ✔️ | | One of 'create', 'create_from_files', 'update', delete', 'add_media', 'delete_media', 'update_media', 'export_csv', 'get_data_from_view', 'create_terms', or 'delete_media_by_node'. See "[Choosing a task](/islandora_workbench_docs/choosing_a_task/)" for more information.
| host | ✔️ | | The hostname, including `http://` or `https://` of your Islandora repository, and port number if not the default 80. |
| username |  ✔️ | | The username used to authenticate the requests. This Drupal user should be a member of the "Administrator" role. If you want to create nodes that are owned by a specific Drupal user, include their numeric user ID in the `uid` column in your CSV. |
| password |  | | The user's password. You can also set the password in your `ISLANDORA_WORKBENCH_PASSWORD` environment variable. If you do this, omit the `password` option in your configuration file. If a password is not available in either your configuration file or in the environment variable, Workbench will prompt for a password.|

### Drupal settings

| Setting | Required | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| content_type |  | islandora_object | The machine name of the Drupal node content type you are creating or updating. Required in "create" and "update" tasks. |
| drupal_filesystem | | fedora:// | One of 'fedora://', 'public://', or 'private://' (the wrapping quotation marks are required). Only used with Drupal 8.x - 9.1; starting with Drupal 9.2, the filesystem is automatically detected from the media's configuration. Will eventually be deprecated. |
| allow_adding_terms |  | false | In `create`, `update`, `add_media`, `update_media`, `create_terms`, and `update_terms` tasks, determines if Workbench will add taxonomy terms if they do not exist in the target vocabulary. See more information in the "[Taxonomy reference fields](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#taxonomy-reference-fields)" section. Note: this setting is not required in `create_terms` tasks unless you are adding new terms to a taxonomy reference field on the term entries. |
| protected_vocabularies |  | [] (empty list)  | Allows you to exclude vocabularies from having new terms added via `allow_adding_terms`. See more information in the "[Taxonomy reference fields](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#taxonomy-reference-fields)" section. |
| vocab_id | ✔️ in `create_terms` tasks. | | Identifies the vocabulary you are adding terms to in `create_tersm` tasks. See more information in the "[Creating taxonomy terms](/islandora_workbench_docs/creating_taxonomy_terms)" section. |
| update_mode |  | replace | Determines if Workbench will `replace`, `append` (add to) , or `delete` field values during `update` tasks. See more information in the "[Updating nodes](/islandora_workbench_docs/updating_nodes)" section. Also applies to `update_media` tasks. |
| validate_terms_exist |  | true | If set to false, during `--check` Workbench will not query Drupal to determine if taxonomy terms exist. The structure of term values in CSV are still validated; this option only tells Workbench to not check for each term's existence in the target Drupal. Useful to speed up the `--check` process if you know terms don't exist in the target Drupal. |
| validate_parent_node_exists |  | true | If set to false, during `--check` Workbench will not query Drupal to determine if nodes whose node IDs are in `field_member_of` exist. Useful to speed up the `--check` process if you know terms already exist in the target Drupal. |
| max_node_title_length |  | 255 | Set to the number of allowed characters for node titles if your Drupal uses [Node Title Length](https://www.drupal.org/project/title_length). If unsure what your the maximum length of the node titles your site allows, check the length of the "title" column in your Drupal database's "node_field_data" table. |
| max_image_alt_text_length |  | 255 | Set to the number of allowed characters for image alt text values. Drupal's database structure limits this to 255 characters. |
| list_missing_drupal_fields |  | false | Set to `true` to tell Workbench to provide a list of fields that exist in your input CSV but that cannot be matched to Drupal field names (or reserved column names such as "file"). If `false`, Workbench will still check for CSV column headers that it can't match to Drupal fields, but will exit upon finding the first such field. This option produces a list of fields instead of exiting on detecting the first field.|
| standalone_media_url |  | false | Set to `true` if your Drupal instance has the "Standalone media URL" option at `/admin/config/media/media-settings` checked. The Drupal default is to have this unchecked, so you only need to use this Workbench option if you have changed Drupal's default. [More information](/islandora_workbench_docs/installation/#configuring-drupals-media-urls) is available. |
| require_entity_reference_views |  | true | Set to `false` to tell Workbench to not require a View to expose the values in an entity reference field configured to use an Entity Reference View. Additional information is available [here](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#entity-reference-views-fields). |
| entity_reference_view_endpoints |  | | A list of mappings from Drupal/CSV field names to Views REST Export endpoints used to look up term names for entity reference field configured to use an Entity Reference View. Additional information is available [here](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#entity-reference-views-fields). |
| text_format_id |  | basic_html | The text format ID (machine name) to apply to all Drupal text fields that have a "formatted" field type. See "[Text fields with markup](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#text-fields-with-markup)" for more information. |
| field_text_format_ids |  | | Defines a mapping between field machine names the machine names of format IDs for "formatted" fields. See "[Text fields with markup](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#text-fields-with-markup)" for more information. |
| paragraph_fields |  | | Defines structure of paragraph fields in the input CSV. See "[Entity Reference Revisions fields (paragraphs)](/islandora_workbench_docs/fields/#entity-reference-revisions-fields-paragraphs)" for more information. |

### Media settings

| Setting | Required | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nodes_only | | false | Include this option in `create` tasks, set to `true`, if you want to only create nodes and not their accompanying media. See the "Creating nodes but not media" section for more information. |
| allow_missing_files | | false | Determines if `file` values that point to missing (not found) files are allowed. Used in the `create` and `add_media` tasks. If set to true, `file` values that point to missing files are allowed. For `create` tasks, a `true` value will result in nodes without attached media. For `add_media` tasks, a `true` value will skip adding a media for the missing `file` CSV value. Defaults to false (which means all `file` values must name files that exist at their specified locations). Note that this setting has no effect on empty `file` values; these are always logged, and their corresponding media are simply not created. |
| exit_on_first_missing_file_during_check | | true | Removed as a configuration setting November 1, 2022. Use `strict_check` instead. |
| strict_check | |  | Replaced with `perform_soft_checks` as of commit dfa60ff (July 14, 2023). |

You can provide a term URI instead of a term ID, for example `"http://pcdm.org/use#OriginalFile"`. You can specify multiple values for this setting by joining them with the subdelimiter configured in the `subdelimiter` setting; for example, `media_use_tid: 17|18`. You can also set this at the object level by including `media_use_tid` in your CSV file; values there will override the value set in your configuration file. If you are "[Adding multiple media](/islandora_workbench_docs/adding_multiple_media/)", you define media use term IDs in a slightly different way. |
| media_type |  ✔️ in `add_media` and `update_media` tasks | | Overrides, for all media being created, Workbench's default definition of whether the media being created is an image, file, document, audio, or video. Used in the `create`, `create_from_files`, `add_media`, and `update_media`, tasks. More detail provided in the "[Configuring Media Types](/islandora_workbench_docs/media_types)" section. Required in all `update_media` and `add_media` tasks, not to override Workbench's defaults, but to explicitly indicate the media type being updated/added. |
| media_types_override | | | Overrides default media type definitions on a per file extension basis. Used in the `create`, `add_media`, and `create_from_files` tasks. More detail provided in the "[Configuring Media Types](/islandora_workbench_docs/media_types)" section. |
| media_type_file_fields | | | Defines the name of the media field that references media's file (i.e., the field on the Media type). Usually used with custom media types and accompanied by either the `media_type` or `media_types_override` option. For more information, see the "[Configuring Media Types](/islandora_workbench_docs/media_types)" section. |
| mimetype_extensions | | | Overrides Workbench's default mappings between MIME types and file extensions. Usually used with remote files where the remote web server returns a MIME type that is not standard. For more information, see the "[Configuring Media Types](/islandora_workbench_docs/media_types)" section. |
| extensions_to_mimetypes | | | Overrides Workbench's default mappings between file extension and MIME types. For more information, see the "[Configuring Media Types](/islandora_workbench_docs/media_types)" section. |
| delete_media_with_nodes | | true | When a node is deleted using a `delete` task, by default, all if its media are automatically deleted. Set this option to false to not delete all of a node's media (you do not generally want to keep the media without the node). |
| use_node_title_for_media_title | | true | If set to `true` (default), name media the same as the parent node's title value. Truncates the value of the field to 255 characters. Applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks. |
| use_nid_in_media_title | | false | If set to `true`, assigns a name to the media following the pattern `{node_id}-Original File`. Set to true to use the parent node's node ID as the media title. Applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks. |
| field_for_media_title | | | Identifies a CSV field name (machine name, not human readable) that will be used as the media title in create tasks. For example, `field_for_media_title: id`. Truncates the value of the field to 255 characters. Applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks. |
| use_node_title_for_remote_filename | | false | Set to true to use a version of the parent node's title as the filename for a remote (http[s]) file. Replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with an underscore (`_`). Truncates the value of the field to 255 characters. Applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks. Note: this setting replaces (the previously undocumented) `use_nid_in_media_filename` setting.|
| field_for_remote_filename | | | Identifies a CSV field name (machine name, not human readable) that will be used as the filename for a remote (http[s]) file. For example, `field_for_remote_filename: id`. Truncates the value of the field to 255 characters. If the field is empty in the CSV, the CSV ID field value will be used. Applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks. Note: this setting replaces (the previously undocumented) `field_for_media_filename` setting.|
| delete_tmp_upload | | false | For remote files, if set to `true`, the temporary copy of the remote file is deleted after it is used to create media. If `false`, the copy will remain in the location defined in your `temp_dir` setting. If the file cannot be deleted (e.g. a virus scanner is scanning it), it will remain and an error message will be added to the log file. |
| additional_files | | | Maps a set of CSV field names to media use terms IDs to create additional media (additional to the media created from the file named in the "file" column, that is) in `create` and `add_media` tasks. See "[Adding multiple media](/islandora_workbench_docs/adding_multiple_media)" for more information. Also used in `export_csv` and `get_data_from_view` tasks to indicate which media to export.

### Miscellaneous settings

| Setting | Required | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| check_for_workbench_updates |  | true | Whether or not to have `--check` compare your local Git commits with those in the "main" branch at https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench and log whether your copy of Workbench is up to date or not. |
| perform_soft_checks |  | false | If set to true, `--check` will not exit when it encounters an error with parent/child order, file extension registration with Drupal media file fields, missing files named in the `files` CSV column, or EDTF validation. Instead, it will log any errors it encounters and exit after it has checked all rows in the CSV input file. Note: this setting replaces `strict_check` as of commit dfa60ff (July 14, 2023). |
| temp_dir |  | Value of the temporary directory defined by your system as defined by Python's [gettempdir()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.gettempdir) function. | Relative or absolute path to the directory where you want Workbench's temporary files to be written. These include the ".preprocessed" version of the your input CSV, remote files temporarily downloaded to create media, and the CSV ID to node ID map database. |

More information is available in the "[Reducing Workbench's impact on Drupal](/islandora_workbench_docs/reducing_load/)" documentation. |
| adaptive_pause |  | | Defines the number of seconds to pause between each REST request to Drupal. Works like "pause" but only takes effect when the Drupal server's response to the most recent request is slower (determined by the "adaptive_pause_threshold" value) than the average response time for the last 20 requests. More information is available in the "[Reducing Workbench's impact on Drupal](/islandora_workbench_docs/reducing_load/)" documentation. |
| adaptive_pause_threshold |  | 2 | A weighting of the response time for the most recent request, relative to the average response times of the last 20 requests. This weighting determines how much slower the Drupal server's response to the most recent Workbench request must be in order for adaptive pausing to take effect for the next request. For example, if set to "1", adaptive pausing will happen when the response time is equal to the average of the last 20 response times; if set to "2", adaptive pausing will take effect if the last requests's response time is double the average. |
| progress_bar |  | false | Show a progress bar when running Workbench instead of row-by-row output. |
| show_percentage_of_csv_input_processed |  | false | Show the percentage of input CSV processed in each line of output in `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `add_media` tasks. |

For details on when to use this option, refer to the end of the "Secondary Tasks" section of "[Creating paged, compound, and collection content](/islandora_workbench_docs/paged_and_compound/#using-a-secondary-task)". Note: this setting goes in the config file for the primary task, not the secondary tasks' config files. |
| path_to_workbench_script |  | workbench | Used in `create` tasks that also use the `secondary_tasks` option. Tells Workbench the path to the `workbench` script. For details on when to use this option, refer to the end of the "Secondary Tasks" section of "[Creating paged, compound, and collection content](/islandora_workbench_docs/paged_and_compound/#using-a-secondary-task)". Note: this setting goes in the config file for the primary task, not the secondary tasks' config files. |
| contact_sheet_output_dir |  | contact_sheet_output | Used in `create` tasks to specify the name of the directory where contact sheet output is written. Can be relative (to the Workbench directory) or absolute. See "[Generating a contact sheet](/islandora_workbench_docs/contact_sheet/)" for more information. |
| contact_sheet_css_path |  | assets/contact_sheet/contact-sheet.css | Used in `create` tasks to specify the path of the CSS stylesheet to use in contact sheets. Can be relative (to the Workbench directory) or absolute. See "[Generating a contact sheet](/islandora_workbench_docs/contact_sheet/)" for more information. |
| node_exists_verification_view_endpoint |  | | Used in `create` tasks to tell Workbench to check whether a node with a matching value in your input CSV already exists. See "[Checking if nodes already exist](/islandora_workbench_docs/checking_if_nodes_exist/)" for more information. |

| completion_message |  | None | A message to display to the user just before Workbench completes executing. |
| check_lock_file_path |  |  | Defines a "lock file" that contains data generated by a successful `--check`. See "[Checking configuration and input data](/islandora_workbench_docs/check/)" for more information. |
| secondary_tasks |  | | A list of configuration file names that are executed as secondary tasks after the primary task to create compound objects. See "[Using a secondary task](/islandora_workbench_docs/paged_and_compound/#using-a-secondary-task)" for more information. |
| prompt_user_before_delete_task |  | false | If set to `true`, Workbench will prompt the user "You are about to delete [number] nodes and their attached media. Continue? (y/n)". See "[Deleting nodes](/islandora_workbench_docs/deleting_nodes/)" for more information.  |

When you run Islandora Workbench with the `--check` argument, it will verify that all configuration options required for the current task are present, and if they aren't tell you so.

!!! note
    Islandora Workbench automatically converts any configuration keys to lowercase, e.g., `Task` is equivalent to `task`.

## Validating the syntax of the configuration file

When you run Workbench, it confirms that your configuration file is valid YAML. This is a syntax check only, not a content check. If the file is valid YAML, Workbench then goes on to perform a long list of application-specific [checks](/islandora_workbench_docs/check).

If this syntax check fails, some detail about the problem will be displayed to the user. The same information plus the entire Python stack trace is also logged to a file named "workbench.log" in the directory Islandora Workbench is run from. This file name is Workbench's default log file name, but in this case (validating the config file's YAML syntax), that file name is used regardless of the log file location defined in the configuration's `log_file_path` option. The reason the error is logged in the default location instead of the value in the configuration file (if one is present) is that the configuration file isn't valid YAML and therefore can't be parsed.

## Example configuration files

These examples provide inline annotations explaining why the settings are included in the configuration file. Blank rows/lines are included for readability.

### Create nodes only, no media

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora

# This setting tells Workbench to create nodes with no media.
# Also, this tells --check to skip all validation of "file" locations.
# Other media settings, like "media_use_tid", are also ignored.
nodes_only: true
```

### Use a custom log file location

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora

# This setting tells Workbench to write its log file to the location specified
# instead of the default "workbench.log" within the directory Workbench is run from.
log_file_path: /home/mark/workbench_log.txt
```

### Include some CSV field templates

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora

# The values in this list of field templates are applied to every row in the
# input CSV file before the CSV file is used to populate Drupal fields. The
# field templates are also applied during the "--check" in order to validate
# the values of the fields.
csv_field_templates:
 - field_member_of: 205
 - field_model: 25
```

### Use a Google Sheet as input CSV

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora
input_csv: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Mw7gtBy1A3ZhYEAlBzmkswIdaZvX18xoRBxfbgxqWc/edit
# You only need to specify the google_sheets_gid option if the worksheet in the Google Sheet
# is not the default one.
google_sheets_gid: 1867618389
```

### Create nodes and media from files (no input CSV file)

```yaml
task: create_from_files
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora

# The files to create the nodes from are in this directory.
input_dir: /tmp/sample_files

# This tells Workbench to write a CSV file containing node IDs of the
# created nodes, plus the field names used in the target content type
# ("islandora_object" by default).
output_csv: /tmp/sample_files.csv

# All nodes should get the "Model" value corresponding to this URI.
model: 'https://schema.org/DigitalDocument'
```

### Create taxonomy terms

```yaml
task: create_terms
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora
input_csv: my_term_data.csv
vocab_id: myvocabulary
```

### Ignore some columns in your input CSV file

```yaml
task: create
host: https://localhost
username: admin
password: islandora
input_csv: input.csv

# This tells Workbench to ignore the 'date_generated' and 'batch_id'
# columns in the input.csv file.
ignore_csv_columns: ['date_generated', 'batch_id']
```

### Generating sample Islandora content

```yaml
task: create_from_files
