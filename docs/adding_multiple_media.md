By default, Islandora Workbench adds only one media per node. This applies to both `create` and `add_media` tasks, and the file that is used to create the media is the one named in the "file" CSV column. The media use term ID is defined in either the `media_use_tid` configuration option or in the "media_use_tid" CSV field.

However, it is possible to add more than a single media per node in `create` and `add_media` tasks. This ability might be useful if you have pre-generated derivatives (thumbnails, OCR, etc.) or if you want to add the main file (e.g. with a media use term of "Original File") and one or more files that are not generated by Islandora's microservices. Workbench looks for the `additional_files` configuration option, which maps CSV field names to media use term IDs. If the field names defined in this option exist in your CSV (in either a `create` task or an `add_media` task), Workbench creates a media for each file and assigns it the corresponding media use term. Here is an example of this configuration option:

```yaml
additional_files:
 - thumbnail: 20
 - rightsdocs: 280
```

!!! note
    The syntax of the `additional_files` entries is important. Be sure to include a space after the dash at the start of each entry, like `- rightsdocs`, not `-rightsdocs`.

The accompanying `create` CSV would look like this:

```text
file,id,title,thumbnail,rightsdocs
main.jpg,036,Testing,/tmp/thumbs/main_tn.jpg,/tmp/rightsdocs/036.txt
```

The accompanying `add_media` CSV using the same sample file paths would look like this:

```text
file,node_id,thumbnail,rightsdocs
main.jpg,2078,/tmp/thumbs/main_tn.jpg,/tmp/rightsdocs/036.txt
```

You can use multiple media use term IDs by subdelimiting them, e.g.:

```yaml
additional_files:
 - thumbnail: 20
 - rightsdocs: 280|465
```

!!! warning
    If you are creating Media using this feature, you should temporarily disable Contexts that would normally generate derivatives equivalent to the additional Media you are creating. Do this at `admin/structure/context` by choosing "Disable" in the "Operations" list for each applicable Context, and be sure to re-enable them after running Workbench. Because Islandora creates derivatives asynchronously, it is impossible to guarantee that Contexts will not overwrite additional Media created using this feature. Running `--check` will warn you of this by issuing a message like the following: "Warning: Term ID '18' registered in the 'additional_files' config option for field 'thumbnail' will assign an Islandora Media Use term that might conflict with derivative media. You should temporarily disable the Context or Action that generates those derivatives."

A few notes:

* If the `additional_files` columns are empty in any rows, or if the reserved `file` column is empty because all file-related columns are listed in additional_files, you will need to add the `allow_missing_files: true` option to your configuration file.
* [Fixity checking](/islandora_workbench_docs/fixity) is only available for files named in the `file` CSV column, not in the additional columns described here. See [this issue](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench/issues/307) for more information.
* If you create an "Extracted Text" media, the contents of the specified text file will be added to the media's "field_edited_text" field, allowing it to be indexed in Solr.
* Mappings of file extensions to Islandora media types configured via the `media_types_override` config setting apply to files named in the `file` CSV column and in columns defined in the `additional_files` setting.
